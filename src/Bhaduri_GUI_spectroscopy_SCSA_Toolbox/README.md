# GUI spectroscopy

Semi-Classical Signal Analysis (SCSA) based Spectroscopy toolbox for water suppression and data denoising, which allows researchers to perform water suppression and denoising of MRS data and data fitting as an additional feature. 
The fitting module can be passed on to other sophisticated software. The toolbox is easy to install and to use : 
1) import .mat files in a specific structure and allow visualization of spectroscopy data, 
2) allowing processing of single voxel and multi-voxel spectra, 
3) perform water suppression and denoising, 
4) perform nonlinear least squares iterative data fitting. 

### Dataset  
Any MRS datset in Siemens and philips format 

### Run the GUI tool  
In order to run the tool, you need to have Matlab installed. Second, use GUI_start.m file to start the tool
